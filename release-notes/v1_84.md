## Workbench

### Customise Activity Bar Position

You can now move the Activity Bar to top of the Side Bar as shown in the following video.

![move activity bar position](images/1_84/activity_bar_position.gif)

When the Activity Bar is placed on the top, the Accounts and Settings actions are moved to the title bar to the far right.

**Note:** This is supported only when the custom title bar is enabled.

### TF-IDF in the Settings editor

The Settings editor now runs a TF-IDF search after a keyword match search for users without GitHub Copilot Chat installed.

For users with GitHub Copilot Chat installed, the Copilot Chat search is run after the keyword match search instead.

The TF-IDF search, which behaves like a "fuzzy keyword match" search, runs faster than the GitHub Copilot Chat search, but the results are not as accurate.

## Editor

### Inline Chat

This iteration it has been made possible to show a sparkle icon in the gutter of the editor when the cursor is on an empty line and the selection is empty. When this icon is clicked, it spawns the inline chat. The corresponding setting is `inlineChat.showGutterIcon` and it is disabled by default.

## Accessibility

### Clear, format, and save opt-in audio cues

When `audioCues.clear` is enabled, a sound will indicate that the terminal, a notification, or the chat responses have been cleared.

In files and notebooks, `audioCues.save` and `audioCues.format` can be set to play on user gesture or always for each event. While disabled, an aria alert will be used instead and can be customized with `accessibility.alert.format` and `accessibility.alert.save`.

### Windows magnifier synced

The windows magnifier now follows the cursor in VS Code properly.

### Accessible view improvements

By default, a user's cursor will be positioned at the bottom of the terminal accessible view; to preserve it intead, `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewPreserveCursorPosition` can be enabled.

The accessible view can be hidden with `accessibility.hideAccessibleView`, useful if sharing one's screen with an audience of sighted users.

The accessible view now closes when a user starts typing and will focus the prior element for a smoother work flow.

### Text editor in window title focused view

Last iteration, we added a `${focusedView}` variable to `window.title`. We now indicate when a `Text Editor` is focused.

## Extension authoring

### Updated Codicons

The following new icons were added to our [codicon](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels) library:
* `copilot`
* `git-fetch`
* `mic`
* `mic-filled`
* `thumbsup-filled`
* `coffee`
* `snake`
* `game`
* `vr`
* `chip`
* `piano`
* `music`
* `thumbsup-filled`
* `thumbsdown-filled`

### New theme colors

* `textPreformatBackground`: Background color for preformatted text segments

## Documentation and extensions

### Gradle for Java

Java development in VS Code just got easier with the improved [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. The pre-release version has better support for building Gradle projects thanks to adopting the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io) (BSP). Similar to other protocols used in VS Code, for example the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) (LSP), the BSP provides an abstraction layer between development environments and build tools such as Gradle.

To try out the new Gradle support, install both the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) and pre-release version of the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. You can learn more about Gradle and the BSP in this recent [blog post from the Java extension team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/new-build-server-for-gradle).
