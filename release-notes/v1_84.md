## Workbench

### Customise Activity Bar Position

You can now move the Activity Bar to top of the Side Bar as shown in the following video.

![move activity bar position](images/1_84/activity_bar_position.gif)

When the Activity Bar is placed on the top, the Accounts and Settings actions are moved to the title bar to the far right.

**Note:** This is supported only when the custom title bar is enabled.

### TF-IDF in the Settings editor

The Settings editor now runs a TF-IDF search after a keyword match search for users without GitHub Copilot Chat installed.

For users with GitHub Copilot Chat installed, the Copilot Chat search is run after the keyword match search instead.

The TF-IDF search, which behaves like a "fuzzy keyword match" search, runs faster than the GitHub Copilot Chat search, but the results are not as accurate.

## Editor

### Inline Chat

This iteration it has been made possible to show a sparkle icon in the gutter of the editor when the cursor is on an empty line and the selection is empty. When this icon is clicked, it spawns the inline chat. The corresponding setting is `inlineChat.showGutterIcon` and it is disabled by default.

### Nearest Quick Fix keyboard shortcut

There is a new setting to activate the nearest Quick Fix in a line from `kb(editor.action.quickFix)` (command ID `editor.action.quickFix`), no matter where your cursor is in that line. Previously a preview feature, **Code Action Widget: Include Nearby Quickfixes** (`editor.codeActionWidget.includeNearbyQuickfixes`) is now enabled by default.

The command highlights the source code that will be refactored or fixed with Quick Fixes. Normal Code Actions and non-fix refactorings can still be activated at the cursor location.

![Example of new Quick Fix behavior, showing activation on nearest errors, and showing how all Code Actions can still be utilized at the cursor location](images/1_83/nearest-quick-fix.gif)

## Accessibility

### Clear, format, and save opt-in audio cues

When `audioCues.clear` is enabled, a sound will indicate that the terminal, a notification, or the chat responses have been cleared.

In files and notebooks, `audioCues.save` and `audioCues.format` can be set to play on user gesture or always for each event. While disabled, an aria alert will be used instead and can be customized with `accessibility.alert.format` and `accessibility.alert.save`.

### Windows magnifier synced

The windows magnifier now follows the cursor in VS Code properly.

### Accessible view improvements

By default, a user's cursor will be positioned at the bottom of the terminal accessible view; to preserve it intead, `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewPreserveCursorPosition` can be enabled.

The accessible view can be hidden with `accessibility.hideAccessibleView`, useful if sharing one's screen with an audience of sighted users.

The accessible view now closes when a user starts typing and will focus the prior element for a smoother work flow.

### Text editor in window title focused view

Last iteration, we added a `${focusedView}` variable to `window.title`. We now indicate when a `Text Editor` is focused.

## Notebooks

### Scroll on Execute improvements

More improvements have been made to how the next cells are revealed when executing through notebooks with `shift` + `enter` to help focus on the output as well as reducing the amount of cell movement when re-executing cells that already have output.

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Improvements to Run Line in the Terminal

The Python extension is working on improving the behavior of sending lines to the Python REPL (`Shift+Enter`) when no code has been selected to run. Previously, once you placed the cursor on a line of Python code and pressed `Shift+Enter`, the Python extension would send the exact line content to the REPL, even if it would fail due to e.g. being part of a multi-line command.

With our new Smart Send feature, the Python extension will send the smallest possible block of code that includes the line where your cursor is currently on to the REPL for execution. This ensures that only complete and executable sections of code are sent to the REPL. The cursor will also be automatically placed to the next executable line, to provide a smooth experience when executing  multiple chunks iteratively.

To try it out, you can add the following **User** setting: `"python.experiments.optInto: ["pythonREPLSmartSend"]`

#### Improvements to Python linting extensions

We have made several improvements to the linting extensions our team supports to allow for an even more configurable and flexible experience with your favorite Python tools.

The [Pylint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint), [Mypy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker) and [Flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) extensions now offer settings that allow you to specify glob patterns for files that you wish to exclude from linting. This can be useful if you are working with a large codebase with many subprojects, and want to exclude certain folders from being linted.

These settings are `"pylint.ignorePatterns"`, `"mypy-type-checker.ignorePatterns"` and `"flake8.ignorePatterns"`, respectively.

These extensions also support `cwd` settings, which allows you to specify the working directory for the linter. This setting has been updated to support the variable `${fileDirname}`, so the working directory can be dynamically set to the parent folder of the file you have open in the editor. This can be particularly useful if you are working with mono repos, and want the linter working directory to be dynamically updated as you open files from different subprojects. These settings are `"pylint.cwd"`, `"mypy-type-checker.cwd"` and `"flake8.cwd"`, respectively.

We have also changed the default value of the `"mypy-type-checker.preferDaemon"`, only applicable to the Mypy extension. Previously, it was set to `true`, which meant that the Mypy daemon would be used by default. After receiving feedback, we have changed the default value to `false`. If you are wondering which value would best for you, our recommendation is to use the Mypy daemon if you enabled the Mypy reporting scope to be the entire workspace (`"mypy-type-checker.reportingScope": "workspace"`) for performance reasons. Otherwise, if the reporting scope is set to the current file, we recommend you to use the Mypy executable that shipped with the extension.

#### Deprecated built-in linting and formatting features

With all the ongoing work and improvements we have been making to the linting and formatting extensions in VS Code for the last year, we have [deprecated the built-in linting and formatting features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Migration-to-Python-Tools-Extensions) that are shipped in the Python extension. This includes all the linting and formatting commands as well as settings (`python.linting.*` and `python.formatting.*`). We recommend you to remove these deprecated settings if you are still using them, and use the linting and formatting extensions that we support instead, as they offer a more configurable and flexible experience.

If you were using a linter that we don't have an extension for, we recommend you check out the community-contributed [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff). [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is a Python linter written in Rust and [it supports various linters](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) such as pyflakes, pycodestyle, pydocstyle, and more! They have also recently enabled support for using Ruff as a formatter in VS Code (`"[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff" }`).

You can also create your own linter or formatter VS Code extension for your favorite Python tool! Check out our [Python Tools Extension Template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-tools-extension-template) for a quick start.


#### Create environment notification

[Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) are highly recommended when working with Python projects that have dependencies that need to be installed. They offer isolation and reproducibility, and are one of the most popular recommended way to manage dependencies in Python projects.

For this reason, the Python extension now displays a notification once you attempt to run or debug a Python file or project with listed dependencies when you don't have a virtual environment selected on your workspace. This notification provides a quick way to create a new virtual environment through the **Python: Create Environment** command.

If you already have a virtual environment on your workspace, you have the option to select it, or delete and recreate it.

This notification can be disabled by setting `python.python.createEnvironment.trigger` to `off`.

![Notification stating that a virtual environment is not currently selected with an option to Create the environment or disable the notification.](images/1_84/create-env-prompt.png)

#### Platform-specific versions of the Python Debugger extension

The Python Debugger extension now has platform-specific versions, which means only the necessary files for your platform will be installed on every update. This reduces the size of the extension and helps with improving startup time.

## Extension authoring

## Documentation and extensions

### Gradle for Java

Java development in VS Code just got easier with the improved [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. The pre-release version has better support for building Gradle projects thanks to adopting the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io) (BSP). Similar to other protocols used in VS Code, for example the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) (LSP), the BSP provides an abstraction layer between development environments and build tools such as Gradle.

To try out the new Gradle support, install both the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) and pre-release version of the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. You can learn more about Gradle and the BSP in this recent [blog post from the Java extension team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/new-build-server-for-gradle).

![Gradle for Java pre-release extension](images/1_84/gradle-extension.png)

### FastAPI Tutorial

FastAPI is a modern and fast web framework for building Python APIs, and it's become more and more popular thanks to its simplicity and performance.

You can now learn how you can get the best out of VS Code and the Python extension to create and debug FastAPI applications through our new [FastAPI Tutorial](/docs/python/tutorial-fastapi.md)!


## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support configuring data sent to extensions via Issue Reporter

A new proposed API will allow extension authors to configure additional data sent via the Issue Reporter.

``` ts
        export interface IssueUriRequestHandler {
		// Handle the request by the issue reporter for the Uri you want to direct the user to.
		handleIssueUrlRequest(): ProviderResult<Uri>;
	}

        export interface IssueDataProvider {
		// Provide the data to be used in the issue reporter.
		provideIssueData(token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<string>;

		// Provide the template to be used in the description of issue reporter.
		provideIssueTemplate(token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<string>;
	}

        export namespace env {
		export function registerIssueUriRequestHandler(handler: IssueUriRequestHandler): Disposable;
		export function registerIssueDataProvider(provider: IssueDataProvider): Disposable;
	}
```

You can provide a `URI` via `handleIssueUrlRequest` to have the extension issue filed externally on GitHub, or provide a template `string` and extension data `string` for `provideIssueData` and `provideIssueTemplate` in order to send additional extension data to GitHub via the Issue Reporter.

Read more about this proposal in [issue #196863](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196863)!
