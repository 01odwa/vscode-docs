## Accessibility

### Clear, format, and save opt-in audio cues

When `audioCues.clear` is enabled, a sound indicates that the terminal, a notification, or the chat responses have been cleared.

In files and notebooks, `audioCues.save` and `audioCues.format` can be set to play on user gesture or always for each event. While disabled, an aria alert will be used instead and can be customized with `accessibility.alert.format` and `accessibility.alert.save`.

### Windows magnifier synced

The windows magnifier now follows the cursor in VS Code properly.

### Accessible View improvements

By default, a user's cursor is positioned at the bottom of the terminal Accessible View; to preserve the position instead, you can set `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewPreserveCursorPosition` to `true`.

The Accessible View can be hidden with `accessibility.hideAccessibleView`, useful if sharing one's screen with an audience of sighted users.

The Accessible View now closes when a user starts typing and will focus the prior element for a smoother work flow.

### Text editor in window title focused view

Last iteration, we added a `${focusedView}` variable to `window.title`. We now indicate when a `Text Editor` is focused.

## Workbench

### Customize Activity bar position

You can now move the Activity bar to top of the Side Bar as shown in the following video.

![Move Activity bar position](images/1_84/activity_bar_position.gif)

When the Activity bar is placed on the top, the Accounts and Manage buttons are moved to the title bar to the far right.

**Note:** This is supported only when the custom title bar is enabled.

### Hide Editor Tabs

Users are now able to hide editor tabs by setting `workbench.editor.showTabs` to `none`.

![Hide tab bar](images/1_84/hide-tab-bar.gif)

### Maximize Editor Group

We introduced a method to maximize an editor group (command ID `workbench.action.toggleMaximizeEditorGroup`). This will hide all other groups and adds a button to the tab bar, allowing the user to restore the previous layout. When changing the setting `workbench.editor.doubleClickTabToToggleEditorGroupSizes` to `maximize`, users can double click on an editor tab to maximize & unamximize the editor group.

![Maximize editor group](images/1_84/maximize-editor-group.gif)

### TF-IDF in the Settings editor

The Settings editor now runs a [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (term frequency-inverse document frequency) search after a keyword match search for users without the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extension installed.

For users with GitHub Copilot Chat installed, the Copilot Chat search is run after the keyword match search instead.

The TF-IDF search, which behaves like a "fuzzy keyword match" search, runs faster than the GitHub Copilot Chat search, but the results are not as accurate.

![The query "automatically save files" in the Settings editor showing some auto save settings](images/1_84/se-tfidf.png)

### Confirmation for opening protocol links

When a protocol link for a file or workspace opens in VS Code, a dialog will now ask for confirmation:

![Confirm Protocol Links](images/1_84/confirm-protocol-link.png)

Protocol links can either point to a local file (for example `vscode://file/path/to/file`) or to a remote file (for example `vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/path/to/file`). For each case there are new settings to disable this behaviour:
* `security.promptForLocalFileProtocolHandling`: for local protocol links
* `security.promptForRemoteFileProtocolHandling`: for remote protocol links

## Editor

### Nearest Quick Fix keyboard shortcut

There is a new setting to activate the nearest Quick Fix in a line from `kb(editor.action.quickFix)` (command ID `editor.action.quickFix`), no matter where your cursor is in that line. Previously a preview feature, **Code Action Widget: Include Nearby Quick Fixes** (`editor.codeActionWidget.includeNearbyQuickFixes`) is now enabled by default.

The command highlights the source code that will be refactored or fixed with Quick Fixes. Normal Code Actions and non-fix refactorings can still be activated at the cursor location.

![Example of new Quick Fix behavior, showing activation on nearest errors, and showing how all Code Actions can still be utilized at the cursor location](images/1_83/nearest-quick-fix.gif)

### Multi-Document Highlighting

Initial support for code highlighting across multiple documents has been added via the setting **Editor: Multi Document Occurrences** (`editor.multiDocumentOccurrencesHighlight`). This initial implementation features only textual occurences, with support for semantic highlighting coming in the future.

<video src="images/1_84/multi-doc-occurrences.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Multi Document Highlighting in VS Code"></video>

## Terminal

## Source Control

### Commit Message Generation using Copilot

For users that have the Copilot Chat extension installed, this milestone we have added the ability to generate commit messages based on the pending changes using the new "Sparkle" action in the source control input box.

### Force push using `--force-if-includes`

Driven by a community contribution, this milestone we have added support for the `--force-if-includes` option which is an auxiliary option to `--force-with-lease` added in Git 2.30. The new option ensures that the commits that are being being force-pushed were created after examining the commit at the tip of the remote reference, and reduces the chance of losing commits when auto fetch is enabled. You can disable the use of `--force-if-includes` by toggling the `git.useForcePushIfIncludes` setting.

## Notebooks

### Scroll on Execute improvements

More improvements have been made to how the next cells are revealed when executing through notebooks with `Shift+Enter` to help focus on the output as well as reducing the amount of cell movement when re-executing cells that already have output.

<video src="images/1_84/notebook-scrolling-output.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Focus output after execution"></video>

### IPython Stack Trace Rendering

Exception stack traces from IPython will now render clickable links to help navigate to the error. This will only apply if the Jupyter extension does not alter them first: `"jupyter.formatStackTraces": false`.

<video src="images/1_84/stack-trace-links.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Clickable stack trace frames from IPython"></video>

## Languages

## Debug

### JavaScript Debugger

#### Improved Event Listener Breakpoints View

Thanks to a community contribution, the Event Listener breakpoints view is friendlier and is now presented as a tree with checkboxes:

![](./images/1_84/js-debug-event-listener-bps.png)

#### Better Handling of Sourcemap Renames

When code is compiled with a bundler, variables can be renamed. This is especially common with imports in all bundlers, and certain local identifiers in esbuild. The debugger is now aware of scopes each rename applies to, which fixes many snags users historically hit.

This requires the debugger to parse the syntax tree of compiled modules. This is done in a background thread and only when renames are detected, but the behavior can be disabled by setting `"sourceMapRenames": false` in your `launch.json` to avoid a performance impact.

## Contributions to extensions

### Jupyter

#### Execute with Precedent/Dependent Cells

You can now run all precedent or dependent cells of a target cell from the dropdown menu next to the Cell Run button. This is still a preview feature and can be enabled with the `jupyter.executionAnalysis.enabled` setting and the `notebook.consolidatedRunButton` setting.

This feature is currently powered by the [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension so you will need to install the latest Prerelease version of Pylance to use this feature.

<video src="images/1_84/run-dependent-cell.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Run Precedent/Dependent Cells"></video>

### GitHub Copilot

#### Streaming inline chat

Inline chat can now make progressive text edits and "types" at the rate at which a response being received. This is a more natural experience than the previous behavior of waiting for the entire chat response to be received before applying it to the editor.

<video src="images/1_83/chat-inline-stream.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Inline chat making progressive edits"></video>

Not all edits are insertions and for replacements Copilot sometimes has a hard time to figure out where to start. In those cases, streaming might not yet work as expected. Stay tuned for improvements in this area

#### Inline chat sparkle

This iteration it has been made possible to show a sparkle icon in the gutter of the editor when the cursor is on an empty line and the selection is empty. When this icon is clicked, it spawns the inline chat. The corresponding setting is `inlineChat.showGutterIcon` and it is disabled by default.

#### Chat agents

This iteration, we built a new way to interact with Copilot Chat: agents. Agents are like experts who have a specialty that they can help you with, and you can talk to them in the chat by mentioning them with the `@` symbol. Currently, there are two agents:

* `@workspace` has context about the code in your workspace and can help you navigate it, finding relevant files or classes.
* `@vscode` knows about commands and features in the VS Code editor itself, and can help you use them.

Each agent also supports a few slash commands, and the slash commands that you may have used before should now be used with an agent. For example, `/explain` is now `@workspace /explain`. But as a shortcut, you can also just type `/` to see a list of completions that will automatically expand to the full agent and command.

Try it out, and type `/help` for more tips!

#### Import Grouping

Generated imports are now always put to the top of the file or below existing import blocks.
This is supported for the most common languages.

#### Improved `/explain` context

You can ask Copilot Chat to explain a code selection in your active editor either through the `@workspace /explain` command or through the **Explain with Copilot** action in the context menu. Copilot Chat now includes the implementations of referenced symbols such as functions and classes, leading to more accurate and useful explanations. This works best across files when you have an extension contributing language services installed for one of the following languages: TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, Go or Ruby.

#### Persistent chat view state

Previously, the Copilot Chat view was initially hidden and subsequently shown. The Copilot Chat view now remains active between window reloads so you don't have to manually reopen it. Additionally, the chat view now guides you through the process of signing into GitHub and activating your free trial of GitHub Copilot.

#### Chat using configured display language

By default, Copilot Chat now initially responds using your configured display language in VS Code. You can further override this by configuring `github.copilot.chat.localeOverride`.

#### Reduce welcome message verbosity

You can now control whether Copilot Chat greets you with a verbose welcome message when you first start a conversation by configuring `github.copilot.chat.welcomeMessage`.

#### Terminal quick fixes

When a failed command is run in the terminal, Copilot will now offer a quick fix to explain what happened.

![A sparkle icon shows up that offers to explain a command](images/1_84/copilot-terminal-quick-fix.png)

This can be triggered via the sparkle icon (ctrl/cmd+.) next to the current terminal prompt.

#### Terminal command suggestions

Copilot can now offer CLI command suggestions via the ctrl/cmd+i keybinding when the terminal is focused. This will bring up quick chat with `@workspace /terminal` pre-filled:

![Ctrl/cmd+i now opens up the quick chat](images/1_84/copilot-terminal-command-suggest.png)

This slash command is optimized for suggesting shell commands using the current shell. The quality of suggestions and UX will see more improvements next release.

#### Improved surfacing of run in terminal action

When a code block has a shell language type the `Run in Terminal` action is now surfaced on hover of the code block:

[The code block now shows run in terminal in the top level actions, not hidden in the overflow menu](images/1_84/copilot-terminal-run-action.png)

### Python

#### Improvements to run line in the terminal

The Python extension is working on improving the behavior of sending lines to the Python REPL (`Shift+Enter`) when no code has been selected to run. Previously, when you placed the cursor on a line of Python code and pressed `Shift+Enter`, the Python extension would send the exact line content to the REPL, even if it would fail, for example, due to being part of a multi-line command.

With our new experimental Smart Send feature, the Python extension will send the smallest runnable block of code surrounding the line where your cursor is currently on to the REPL for execution. This ensures that only complete and executable sections of code are sent to the REPL. The cursor will also be automatically placed to the next executable line, to provide a smooth experience when executing  multiple chunks iteratively.

To try it out, you can add the following **User** setting: `"python.experiments.optInto: ["pythonREPLSmartSend"]`. While this feature is currently behind an experiment, we expect it to be the default behavior in the future. If you have feedback or suggestions on how we can further improve this feature, please let us know!

_Theme: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc/Catppuccin%20Macchiato))_

#### Improvements to Python linting extensions

We have made several improvements to the linting extensions our team supports to allow for an even more configurable and flexible experience with your favorite Python tools.

The [Pylint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint), [Mypy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker) and [Flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8) extensions now offer settings that allow you to specify glob patterns for files that you wish to exclude from linting. This can be useful if you are working with a large codebase with many subprojects, and want to exclude certain folders from being linted.

These settings are `"pylint.ignorePatterns"`, `"mypy-type-checker.ignorePatterns"` and `"flake8.ignorePatterns"`, respectively.

These extensions also support `cwd` settings, which allows you to specify the working directory for the linter. This setting has been updated to support the variable `${fileDirname}`, so the working directory can be dynamically set to the parent folder of the file you have open in the editor. This can be particularly useful if you are working with mono repos, and want the linter working directory to be dynamically updated as you open files from different subprojects. These settings are `"pylint.cwd"`, `"mypy-type-checker.cwd"` and `"flake8.cwd"`, respectively.

We have also changed the default value of the `"mypy-type-checker.preferDaemon"`, only applicable to the Mypy extension. Previously, it was set to `true`, which meant that the Mypy daemon would be used by default. After receiving feedback, we have changed the default value to `false`. If you are wondering which value would best for you, our recommendation is to use the Mypy daemon if you enabled the Mypy reporting scope to be the entire workspace (`"mypy-type-checker.reportingScope": "workspace"`) for performance reasons. Otherwise, if the reporting scope is set to the current file, we recommend you to use the Mypy executable that shipped with the extension.

#### Deprecated built-in linting and formatting features

With all the ongoing work and improvements we have been making to the linting and formatting extensions in VS Code for the last year, we have [deprecated the built-in linting and formatting features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/wiki/Migration-to-Python-Tools-Extensions) that are shipped in the Python extension. This includes all the linting and formatting commands as well as settings (`python.linting.*` and `python.formatting.*`). We recommend you to remove these deprecated settings if you are still using them, and use the linting and formatting extensions that we support instead, as they offer a more configurable and flexible experience.

If you were using a linter that we don't have an extension for, we recommend you check out the community-contributed [Ruff extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff). [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) is a Python linter written in Rust and [it supports various linters](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/) such as pyflakes, pycodestyle, pydocstyle, and more! They have also recently enabled support for using Ruff as a formatter in VS Code (`"[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff" }`).

You can also create your own linter or formatter VS Code extension for your favorite Python tool! Check out our [Python Tools Extension Template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-tools-extension-template) for a quick start.

#### Virtual environment deactivation helper
A couple of months ago we announced a new feature under experiment that enables [terminal activation using environment variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_82#_terminal-activation-using-environment-variables), which aims to enhance your development workflow by automatically activating the selected environment in the terminal without the need for explicit activation commands. However, since there are no explicit activation scripts working, the `deactivate` command was no longer working when this experiment was enabled.

The Python extension will now detect when you attempt to run the `deactivate` command and show a helper notification that will guide you on how to add scripts for your shell to enable the command to work again when the environment is activated through environment variables. It also offers a button to more conveniently open your shell profile file for you to add the necessary scripts.

![Notification stating that the deactivate command is not working and offering a button to open the shell profile file.](images/1_84/python-deactivate-notification.png)

You can find the full documentation on how to add the necessary scripts for your shell [here](https://aka.ms/AAmx2ft).

If you are not in the experiment and would like to
try out this feature, you can add the following **User** setting: `"python.experiments.optInto: ["pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation"]`.

#### Improvements to Test Output
We've made significant improvements to how you can view and interact with the Test Output in the Python extension when the `pythonTestAdapter` experiment is enabled, which [we announced a few months ago](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_test-discovery-and-run-rewrite). Previously, output from test discovery and execution was inconsistently scattered across the **Python Test Log** output channel and the **Test Results** panel, with some information being duplicated in both. To consolidate the experience, we are now displaying output related to test execution in the **Test Results** panel, and test discovery in the "Python" channel.

This new approach also supports colorization in the output if you are using Pytest and set `"python.testing.pytestArgs": ["--color=yes"]` in your `settings.json`.
` to get colored output when using Pytest.

![Test execution output displayed in Test Results panel with colors, while test discovery output is displayed in the Python output channel](images/1_84/python-test-output.png)


There is also a new button that allows you to open the Test Logs more easily from the Test Explorer view.

![Button to open the Test Logs in the Test Explorer view](images/1_84/python-test-output-button.png)


#### Create environment notification

[Virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) are highly recommended when working with Python projects that have dependencies that need to be installed. They offer isolation and reproducibility and are one of the most popular and recommended ways to manage dependencies in Python projects.

For this reason, the Python extension now displays a notification once you attempt to run or debug a Python file or project with listed dependencies when you don't have a virtual environment selected on your workspace. This notification provides a quick way to create a new virtual environment through the **Python: Create Environment** command.

If you already have a virtual environment on your workspace, you have the option to select it, or delete and recreate it.

This notification can be disabled by setting `python.python.createEnvironment.trigger` to `off`.

![Notification stating that a virtual environment is not currently selected with an option to Create the environment or disable the notification.](images/1_84/create-env-prompt.png)

#### Platform-specific versions of the Python Debugger extension

The Python Debugger extension now has platform-specific versions, which means only the necessary files for your platform will be installed on every update. This reduces the size of the extension and helps with improving startup time.

#### FastAPI tutorial

FastAPI is a modern and fast web framework for building Python APIs, and it's become more and more popular thanks to its simplicity and performance.

You can now learn how you can get the best out of VS Code and the Python extension to create and debug FastAPI applications through our new [FastAPI Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-fastapi)!


#### Tensorboard extension

The `Tensorboard` functionality has now been moved out of the Python extension into the standalone [Tensorboard extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.tensorboard).

If you have any issues with this new extension or wish to provide feedback, you can file an issue in the [Tensorboard extension GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tensorboard/issues).


### VS Code Speech

We are introducing a new extension to bring voice support to VS Code! The new [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension integrates into [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) to enable voice-to-text transcription services in the chat boxes.

Once installed, you will see a microphone icon appearing that will fill the chat box with text based on the transcription results of your voice. The transcription is computed locally on your machine and does not require a connection to the internet.

![VS Code Speech](images/1_84/vscode-voice.gif)

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which allows you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues.

* Projects are displayed and can be added from the PR description webview.
* Integrated with GitHub Copilot to generate the PR title and description from the PR "Create" view.
* PRs checked out with the GitHub CLI (`gh pr checkout`) are recognized by the extension.

Review the [changelog for the 0.76.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0760) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

## Preview Features

### Floating editor windows

We continued exploring how to pull editors out of the workbench window into their own windows and now want to invite the VS Code insiders community to play with this exciting new feature and provide feedback.

Make sure to install [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) and run the new **View: Move Active Editor into a New Window** on editors to open them in a floating window.

<video src="images/1_84/floating-windows.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Floating windows in VS Code."></video>

We still have to figure out many [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aworkbench-auxwindow+-label%3Afeature-request+) and provide missing [features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aworkbench-auxwindow+label%3Afeature-request), but we are optimistic that we can enable this feature in stable in the near future.

Thanks for testing!

### WASM-WASI support for Language Servers

Support for language servers in WASM/WASI got added to the experimental [wasm-wasi-core](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.wasm-wasi-core) extension. An extension show casing a simple language server written in Rust and compiled to WASM can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wasm/blob/d4fe7c2f4bec260bb97f4f83cec299e146faa985/testbeds/lsp-rust). It depends on the [language server crate](https://docs.rs/lsp-server/latest/lsp_server/) maintained by the [Rust analyzer team](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer).

## Extension authoring

### Improved Test Runner

We now provide a command-line runner and extension for VS Code to make running tests for extensions easier. Extensions using the new approach can now be run in VS Code's testing UI. While some migration is required, this generally only takes a few minutes. See [our documentation](/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension.md) for more information.

### Finalized `TestMessage.contextValue` API

You can provide a `contextValue` on `TestMessage`s to be shown when users take actions on those messages. Additionally, two new menu contributions points are available, `testing/message/context` and `testing/message/content`. The former is displayed on the message in the Test Results tree view, and the latter is displayed over the message in the editor. For example, this might be used to provide an action to update a fixture in snapshot testing:

![](./images/1_84/testmessage-contextvalue.png)

Read more about `contextValue` in [issue #190277](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/190277).

### Updated codicons

The following new icons were added to our [codicon](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels) library:

* `copilot`
* `git-fetch`
* `mic`
* `mic-filled`
* `thumbsup-filled`
* `coffee`
* `snake`
* `game`
* `vr`
* `chip`
* `piano`
* `music`
* `thumbsup-filled`
* `thumbsdown-filled`

### New theme colors

* `textPreformatBackground`: Background color for preformatted text segments

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Support configuring data sent to extensions via Issue Reporter

A new proposed API will allow extension authors to configure additional data sent via the Issue Reporter.

``` ts
        export interface IssueUriRequestHandler {
    // Handle the request by the issue reporter for the Uri you want to direct the user to.
    handleIssueUrlRequest(): ProviderResult<Uri>;
  }

        export interface IssueDataProvider {
    // Provide the data to be used in the issue reporter.
    provideIssueData(token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<string>;

    // Provide the template to be used in the description of issue reporter.
    provideIssueTemplate(token: CancellationToken): ProviderResult<string>;
  }

        export namespace env {
    export function registerIssueUriRequestHandler(handler: IssueUriRequestHandler): Disposable;
    export function registerIssueDataProvider(provider: IssueDataProvider): Disposable;
  }
```

You can provide a `URI` via `handleIssueUrlRequest` to have the extension issue filed externally on GitHub, or provide a template `string` and extension data `string` for `provideIssueData` and `provideIssueTemplate` in order to send additional extension data to GitHub via the Issue Reporter.

Read more about this proposal in [issue #196863](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/196863)!

### File watchers with custom exclude rules

This milestone we added new proposed API for creating file system watchers with full control over exclude rules:

```ts
export interface FileSystemWatcherOptions {
  /**
   * An optional set of glob patterns to exclude from watching.
   * Glob patterns are always matched relative to the watched folder.
   */
  readonly excludes?: string[];
}

export function createFileSystemWatcher(pattern: RelativePattern, options?: FileSystemWatcherOptions): FileSystemWatcher;
```

This new API will give your extension full control over the file watcher, irrespective if its a recursive or non-recursive watcher and whether it wants to watch inside our outside the workspace. User or default configured exclude rules for file watching will not apply, so you can be sure to receive only the events you have subscribed to.

## Engineering

### Windows 32-bit support ends

We've dropped support for Windows 32-bit VS Code. If you're still on 32-bit build of VS Code, please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to the 64-bit version.

## Documentation and extensions

### Custom Layout user guide

There is a new [Custom Layout](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/custom-layout) article describing layout customization for the workbench and editors. There you'll learn how to modify VS Code's main UI elements such as views, panels, and editors to fit your preferred workflow.

![Customize Layout dropdown](images/1_84/customize-layout-dropdown.png)

Topics include:

* Primary and Secondary Side Bars
* Panel position and alignment
* Pinned editor tabs
* Editor group layout
* and more

### Gradle for Java

Java development in VS Code just got easier with the improved [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. The pre-release version has better support for building Gradle projects thanks to adopting the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io) (BSP). Similar to other protocols used in VS Code, for example the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) (LSP), the BSP provides an abstraction layer between development environments and build tools such as Gradle.

To try out the new Gradle support, install both the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) and pre-release version of the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. You can learn more about Gradle and the BSP in this recent [blog post from the Java extension team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/new-build-server-for-gradle).
