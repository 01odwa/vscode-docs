Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the October 1.84 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the October milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[October iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/195109)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22October+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Accessibility

### Clear, format, and save opt-in audio cues

When `audioCues.clear` is enabled, a sound will indicate that the terminal, a notification, or the chat responses have been cleared.

In files and notebooks, `audioCues.save` and `audioCues.format` can be set to play on user gesture or always for each event. While disabled, an aria alert will be used instead and can be customized with `accessibility.alert.format` and `accessibility.alert.save`.

### Accessible view improvements

By default, a user's cursor will be positioned at the bottom of the terminal accessible view; to preserve it intead, `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewPreserveCursorPosition` can be enabled.

The accessible view can be hidden with `accessibility.hideAccessibleView`, useful if sharing one's screen with an audience of sighted users.

### Text Editor in focusedView

Last iteration, we added a `${focusedView}` variable to `window.title`. We now indicate when a `Text Editor` is focused.

## Documentation and extensions

### Gradle for Java

Java development in VS Code just got easier with the improved [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. The pre-release version has better support for building Gradle projects thanks to adopting the [Build Server Protocol](https://build-server-protocol.github.io) (BSP). Similar to other protocols used in VS Code, for example the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) (LSP), the BSP provides an abstraction layer between development environments and build tools such as Gradle.

To try out the new Gradle support, install both the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) and pre-release version of the [Gradle for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle) extension. You can learn more about Gradle and the BSP in this recent [blog post from the Java extension team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/new-build-server-for-gradle).
