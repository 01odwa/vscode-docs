Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.86 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

## Terminal

### Background shown under selection

When GPU acceleration is enabled, cells with non-default background colors will now be rendered "underneath" the regular selection color. This is done in such a way that it still does not change the text color to maintain contrast.

![Cell background colors are now retained, even when selected](./images/1_86/terminal-selection-bg.png)

### Zoom terminal via mouse wheel

The terminal can now be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel when enabled with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.mouseWheelZoom": true
```

### Multi-line paste warning improvements

In previous versions, `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` accepted either `true` (default) or `false`. When `true` was active, it would always show the warning except when either bracketed paste mode is enabled or the line ends in a `\n` character. This setting now accepts a string with the following options:

- `auto`: Previous true behavior
- `always`: Always show it
- `never`: Never show it

Additionally, there is a new button in the dialog to paste the string as a single line which removes all `\r` and `\n` characters.

### Link improvements

File protocol URIs (`file://`) now support line and column number extensions at the end like most other links. The new `#<line>` format is also supported.
