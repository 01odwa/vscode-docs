## Accessibility


## Workbench

### Toggle Word Wrap in Output panel

The Output panel now supports toggling word wrap using `View: Toggle Word Wrap` command. This is useful for viewing long lines of text in the Output panel.

### Open Output Channel in a New Window

The Output panel now has a `Open Output in New Window` action in the panel title menu. This is useful for viewing the Output channel in a separate window.

### Update Extensions from CLI

You can now update extensions from the command line using the `--update-extensions` argument. This will update all installed extensions to their latest version.

## Editor

### Paste text/html content

The `Paste As...` command now lets you paste `text/html` content in the clipboard:

![Using Paste As to paste html content](images/1_86/paste-html.png)

If you copy content from a webpage for example, you can use this to paste the content's html instead of pasting it as plain text:

<video src="images/1_86/paste-html.mp4" title="Pasting content copied from a webpage into a html file. The Live Preview extension is being used to show a preview of the html." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Source Control


## Terminal

### Background shown under selection

When GPU acceleration is enabled, cells with non-default background colors will now be rendered "underneath" the regular selection color. This is done in such a way that it still does not change the text color to maintain contrast.

![Cell background colors are now retained, even when selected](./images/1_86/terminal-selection-bg.png)

### Zoom terminal via mouse wheel

The terminal can now be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel when enabled with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.mouseWheelZoom": true
```

### Multi-line paste warning improvements

In previous versions, `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` accepted either `true` (default) or `false`. When `true` was active, it would always show the warning except when either bracketed paste mode is enabled or the line ends in a `\n` character. This setting now accepts a string with the following options:

- `auto`: Previous true behavior
- `always`: Always show it
- `never`: Never show it

Additionally, there is a new button in the dialog to paste the string as a single line which removes all `\r` and `\n` characters.

### Link improvements

File protocol URIs (`file://`) now support line and column number extensions at the end like most other links. The new `#<line>` format is also supported.

### GitHub Copilot

#### Confirm Inline Chat before saving

We emphasize responsible usage of AI, esp. when it comes to source code. Therefore we have added a new setting that asks users for confirmation before saving code generated by Copilot. This setting is enabled by default, its name is `inlineChat.acceptedOrDiscardBeforeSave`.

![Inline chat save consent](images/1_86/inline-chat-save-consent.png)
_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Default))_

When enabled save will wait for the user to Accept or Discard any pending inline chat session. This also applies when auto-save is enabled which will be temporarily disabled until inline chat has ended.

#### Hold to Speak mode

A little while back we have added speech support to VS Code. Install the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) which adds speech to text support for Chat input fields.

For inline chat we have added "hold to speak". It works like this:

* press `cmd+i` to trigger inline chat
* do not release the keys and notice how voice recording starts
* release the keys, recording stops, and your request is sent to Copilot

_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Default))_

This new mode also comes with a setting, it is only by default but can be disabled with `inlineChat.holdToSpeech`.


#### Preview: Inline Chat Quick Voice

In addition to "hold to speak" we are experimenting with a lighter alternative UI for this. Its keyboard question is the `cmd+k i` chord and while holding `i` a more lightweight recording UI is shown. Upon release the request is made.

#### Inline Chat Live Mode

The past release had a new experiemental inline chat mode called `live3`. It provides a smoother streaming experience and easier to digest diff-view. This has now graduated and replaced the former `live`-mode. The default is still `livePreview` but we encourage users to try out `live`. We are also running an experiement to learn what mode works best for users.
