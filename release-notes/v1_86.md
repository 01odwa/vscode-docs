## Accessibility


## Workbench


## Editor


## Source Control


## Terminal

### Background shown under selection

When GPU acceleration is enabled, cells with non-default background colors will now be rendered "underneath" the regular selection color. This is done in such a way that it still does not change the text color to maintain contrast.

![Cell background colors are now retained, even when selected](./images/1_86/terminal-selection-bg.png)

### Zoom terminal via mouse wheel

The terminal can now be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel when enabled with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.mouseWheelZoom": true
```

### Multi-line paste warning improvements

In previous versions, `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` accepted either `true` (default) or `false`. When `true` was active, it would always show the warning except when either bracketed paste mode is enabled or the line ends in a `\n` character. This setting now accepts a string with the following options:

- `auto`: Previous true behavior
- `always`: Always show it
- `never`: Never show it

Additionally, there is a new button in the dialog to paste the string as a single line which removes all `\r` and `\n` characters.

### Link improvements

File protocol URIs (`file://`) now support line and column number extensions at the end like most other links. The new `#<line>` format is also supported.
