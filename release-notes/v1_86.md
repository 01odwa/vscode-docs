## Accessibility


## Workbench

### Restore auxiliary windows

With this release, all opened floating window associated to a main window will restore when you restart the application. This includes opened editors, size and location of the auxiliary window.

<video src="images/1_86/aux-restore.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Auxiliary Windows Restore"></video>

### Voice: "Hey Code"

With a new setting `accessibility.voice.keywordActivation` you can enable VS Code to understand the "Hey Code" phrase from your microphone to start a voice session with Copilot Chat. Voice recognition is computed locally on your machine and never sent to any server.

Available options are:
* `chatInView`: voice chat from the chat view
* `quickChat`: quick voice chat from the picker control
* `inlineChat`: voice inline chat in the editor
* `chatInContext`: voice inline chat if focus is in the editor, otherwise voice chat from the chat view

See example below for "Hey Code" with the `inlineChat` option configured:

<video src="images/1_86/hey-code.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Hey Code Keyword Activation"></video>

A little microphone icon in the status bar signals when VS Code is listening to the microphone for recognising "Hey Code".

Once the voice chat session is completed, VS Code will again listen to "Hey Code" to start it again.

To use this new capability, the following extensions are required:
* [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
* [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech)

_Note:_ the voice recognition runs locally on your machine and is never sent to any server.

### Per-window zoom levels

A new setting `window.zoomPerWindow` is enabled by default and configures the zoom commands ("Zoom In", "Zoom Out", "Zoom Reset") to apply to the active window and not all opened windows. Previously using these commands would not only apply it to all opened windows but also write it as setting to the `window.zoomLevel`.

We believe that using these commands is more of an ad-hoc gesture, for example when doing a presentation and thus should only apply to the window they are invoked from.

As you can see from this example, only the active view zoom level changes, but not on the other window:

<video src="images/1_86/zoom.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Per-window Zoom"></video>

A window with a custom zoom level that does not match settings indicates as such from a new status bar entry. Click the entry to find controls to change zoom levels, reset the zoom level or quickly go to the related settings.

![Zoom Status Entry](images/1_86/zoom.png)

A window with custom zoom level keeps that zoom level across restarts and across workspace changes.

_Note:_ configure `window.zoomPerWindow` to `false` to restore the behaviour how it used to be.

### More powerful and flexible auto save options

VS Code offered auto save options for a long time. In this release we make this capability a lot more powerful.

#### Configure auto save per resource or language

All auto save settings can now be configured per folder or language allowing to selectively enable auto save only for specific languages or folders.

In the example below, settings are configured as:

```json
{
  "[markdown]": {
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay"
  }
}
```

As you can see, the edited markdown file saves immediately, while the TypeScript file remains dirty.

<video src="images/1_86/autosave.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Auto save per language"></video>

#### New `files.autoSaveWhenNoErrors` setting

A new `files.autoSaveWhenNoErrors` setting allows to disable auto-save if there are error markers in the file at the time auto-save would normally save the editor.

This can be very useful when you have external tools watching for file changes where you want to avoid these tools to act on a state with errors in the file that changed.

#### New `files.autoSaveWorkspaceFilesOnly` setting

Finally, a new setting `files.autoSaveWorkspaceFilesOnly` limits auto-save to files that are inside the workspace only.

### Allow to disable notifications per extension

We now offer more fine grained control for disabling notifications from extensions. From a notification toast you can disable notifications for the extension:

![Turn Off Notifications for an Extension](images/1_86/turn-off-notifications-1.png)

In the notifications center there is a central place to manage notification enablement for all extensions that have triggered a notification:

![Manage Notifications for Extensions](images/1_86/turn-off-notifications-2.png)

_Note:_ this new feature complements our existing "Do Not Disturb Mode" which globally disables all notifications. As with the global switch, error notifications will always appear and cannot be disabled.

### Allow to swap left and right hand diff editor side

When you compare two files (for example from the File Explorer), a new action appears to swap the left with the right hand side of the diff editor.

<video src="images/1_86/swap-diff.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Swap Sides of Diff Editor"></video>

_Note:_ comparing two editable files allows you to make changes on either side.

### Do no enforce `--wait` when reading from stdin from the command line

When using a terminal, you can pass the output of a process directly into VS Code to open as editor, for example:
* `ps aux | grep code | code -` on Linux or macOS
* `echo Hello World | code -` on Windows

Until now, this implied `--wait` as well, meaning that you would not get back to the terminal prompt until you have closed the editor or VS Code. In this milestone, we no longer enforce `--wait` when reading from stdin.

_Note:_ to get the previous behaviour back, simply append `--wait` to the command line invocation.

### New setting to enforce system color theme

A new setting `window.systemColorTheme` allows to explicitly override the system color theme that applies to native elements in VS Code, such as the menu or dialogs on macOS.

By default (`default`) it will match what is configured in the OS, but there are other options:
* `auto`: pick `light` or `dark` depending on the VS Code theme
* `light`: pick `light` system theme
* `dark`: pick `dark` system theme

Below is an example for how this applies to macOS context menus (`light` to the top, `dark` below):

![System Theme Applied to Menus](images/1_86/system-theme.png)

### Allow to close untitled workspaces without confirmation

A new setting and checkbox for the confirmation dialog when closing a window with untitled workspace allows to disable the confirmation. The setting is called `window.confirmSaveUntitledWorkspace` and will by default be enabled to keep the current behaviour.

![Untitled Workspace Confirmation Dialog](images/1_86/untitled-workspace.png)

_Note:_ learn more about untitled workspaces [in our documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces).

### Toggle Word Wrap in Output panel

The Output panel now supports toggling word wrap using `View: Toggle Word Wrap` command. This is useful for viewing long lines of text in the Output panel.

### Open Output Channel in a New Window

The Output panel now has a `Open Output in New Window` action in the panel title menu. This is useful for viewing the Output channel in a separate window.

### Update Extensions from CLI

You can now update extensions from the command line using the `--update-extensions` argument. This will update all installed extensions to their latest version.

## Editor

### Paste text/html content

The `Paste As...` command now lets you paste `text/html` content in the clipboard:

![Using Paste As to paste html content](images/1_86/paste-html.png)

If you copy content from a webpage for example, you can use this to paste the content's html instead of pasting it as plain text:

<video src="images/1_86/paste-html.mp4" title="Pasting content copied from a webpage into a html file. The Live Preview extension is being used to show a preview of the html." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Source Control


## Terminal

### Background shown under selection

When GPU acceleration is enabled, cells with non-default background colors will now be rendered "underneath" the regular selection color. This is done in such a way that it still does not change the text color to maintain contrast.

![Cell background colors are now retained, even when selected](./images/1_86/terminal-selection-bg.png)

### Zoom terminal via mouse wheel

The terminal can now be zoomed in and out with the mouse wheel when enabled with this setting:

```json
"terminal.integrated.mouseWheelZoom": true
```

### Multi-line paste warning improvements

In previous versions, `terminal.integrated.enableMultiLinePasteWarning` accepted either `true` (default) or `false`. When `true` was active, it would always show the warning except when either bracketed paste mode is enabled or the line ends in a `\n` character. This setting now accepts a string with the following options:

- `auto`: Previous true behavior
- `always`: Always show it
- `never`: Never show it

Additionally, there is a new button in the dialog to paste the string as a single line which removes all `\r` and `\n` characters.

### Link improvements

File protocol URIs (`file://`) now support line and column number extensions at the end like most other links. The new `#<line>` format is also supported.


## Tasks


## Debug

### Triggered Breakpoints

You can now set breakpoints that are automatically enabled once another breakpoint is hit. This can be very useful when diagnosing a failure cases in code that happen only after a certain precondition, for example.

Triggered breakpoints can be set by right-clicking on the glyph margin, clicking **Add Triggered Breakpoint...**, and then choosing which breakpoint enables this one.

<video src="../docs/editor/images/debugging/debug-triggered-breakpoint.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Triggered breakpoints work for all languages, and conditional breakpoints may also be used as the trigger.

### Close readonly files when a session ends

When attached to a debugger, there can be internal or virtual source files that don't exist on-disk, which are opened as readonly. There is a new setting, **debug.closeReadonlyTabsOnEnd**, to cause VS Code to automatically close any opened readonly files from the debug session when it ends.

## Testing

### More ways to run tests

Holding `kbstyle(Alt)` while clicking on a test decoration now runs that test in debug mode, when available.

There are now context menu actions in the Explorer view which can be used to run all tests declared in a file or folder.

### Finalized `TestRunProfile.isDefault/onDidChangeDefault` APIs for extension authors

Previously, `TestRunProfile.isDefault` only controlled the initial default state of a test run profile, and it was never changed or read after that point.

In this release, users changing their selected profiles will be reflected in the `TestRunProfile.isDefault` property and fire a corresponding `TestRunProfile.onDidChangeDefault` event. Likewise, extensions' changes to `isDefault` will cause the selected profiles in the UI to update.

## Languages

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

It is now possible to change the font family of the inline suggestions using the setting `editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily`.

#### Confirm Inline Chat before saving

We emphasize responsible usage of AI, esp. when it comes to source code. Therefore we have added a new setting that asks users for confirmation before saving code generated by Copilot. This setting is enabled by default, its name is `inlineChat.acceptedOrDiscardBeforeSave`.

![Inline chat save consent](images/1_86/inline-chat-save-consent.png)
_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Default))_

When enabled save will wait for the user to Accept or Discard any pending inline chat session. This also applies when auto-save is enabled which will be temporarily disabled until inline chat has ended.

#### Hold to Speak mode

A little while back we have added speech support to VS Code. Install the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) which adds speech to text support for Chat input fields.

For inline chat we have added "hold to speak". It works like this:

* press `cmd+i` to trigger inline chat
* do not release the keys and notice how voice recording starts
* release the keys, recording stops, and your request is sent to Copilot

<video src="images/1_86/inline-chat-hold-speak.mp4" title="Hold Cmd+I for Seech, release for request" autoplay loop controls muted></video>
_Theme: [GitHub Light Default](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/GitHub.github-vscode-theme/GitHub%20Light%20Default))_

This new mode also comes with a setting, it is only by default but can be disabled with `inlineChat.holdToSpeech`.


#### Preview: Inline Chat Quick Voice

In addition to "hold to speak" we are experimenting with a lighter alternative UI for this. Its keyboard question is the `cmd+k i` chord and while holding `i` a more lightweight recording UI is shown. Upon release the request is made.

![Quick Voice showing just a microphone indication and your recording](images/1_86/inline-chat-quick-speak.png)


#### Inline Chat Live Mode

The past release had a new experiemental inline chat mode called `live3`. It provides a smoother streaming experience and easier to digest diff-view. This has now graduated and replaced the former `live`-mode. The default is still `livePreview` but we encourage users to try out `live`. We are also running an experiement to learn what mode works best for users.

### Ask for Additional permissions for private repositories

![Modal asking for additional auth](images/1_86/authentication.png)

To enable additional workspace search features for private repositories, we require additional permissions. If we detect that we don't have said permissions already, we will ask for them at startup. Once granted, we'll securely store the session for the future.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features


### TypeScript 5.4 Beta Support
<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Quick Search Improvements
In version 1.82, we introduced [Quick Access Text Search (aka "Quick Search")](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_82#_quick-access-text-search), which allows users to search from a picker. 🔎

Quick Search now has the following features:
- Editor preview on active pick. See the result in the context of the editor as you browse.
- Easier navigation from Quick Search to the search viewlet. Simply click the button beside the input or a result to transfer the results to the search viewlet.

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Test Coverage API

This iteration test coverage's API and in-editor experience has reached feature-complete state. We encourage extension authors to try it out and provide feedback prior to its forecasted finalization in VS Code 1.87.

While the API is too lengthy to include here, we believe it to be fairly straightforward, and would welcome your input on the proposal in [issue #123713](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123713).

## Finalised APIs

### New `workspace.save` and `workspace.saveAs` APIs

The new finalised APIs `workspace.save` and `workspace.saveAs` allow extensions to trigger the flow of saving an editor either to its resource or by asking the user to provide a resource.

All the methods for saving will return the resulting `Uri` or `undefined` if the operation was canceled. Untitled files will always ask the user for a destination unless a path is already associated.
