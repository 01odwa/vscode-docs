<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.85 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197438)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## GitHub Universe, Copilot, and VS Code

If you were able to watch or attend [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this year, you saw that [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was center stage. Copilot was featured in the [Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQkdDVupQE) and breakout sessions such as [GitHub Copilot: the AI pair programmer for today and tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAT4zCfzsHI).

The VS Code team has been working hard to integrate Copilot into the editor and you can learn more about the team's progress leading up to GitHub Universe in the recent [Pursuit of "wicked smartness" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/11/13/vscode-copilot-smarter) blog post. The post details the development of Copilot **agents**, that behave as subject matter experts on code bases and technologies, and describes how extension authors will be able to contribute their own custom agents to VS Code in the future.

## Accessibility

### Accessible View

Last iteration, we introduced automatic closing of the accessible view when a key is pressed to enable a seamless flow between a component and its accessible view. In some cases, this might not be desirable, so can be configured via `accessibility.accessibleView.closeOnKeyPress`.

If a user often toggles between the terminal and the terminal accessible view, they might want to enable `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewFocusOnCommandExecution`, which automatically opens the view when a command has been executed in the terminal.

### Tooltips shown on keyboard focus

To improve the experience for keyboard users, tooltips are now shown on keyboard focus for items with custom hovers around the workbench like activity bar and status bar items.


## Workbench

## Editor

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Git pull quick fix

On checkout of a branch that can be fast forwarded, a terminal quick fix allows for a swift `git pull` execution.

## Tasks

`npm.packageManager` can now be set to `bun` to enable detection and running of such scripts defined in the `package.json`.

## Notebooks

## Debug

## Languages

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_85.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Terminal generate commit message quick fix

Several iterations ago, a Generate Commit Message feature was added to the SCM input box. For terminal users, there is now a quick fix that will generate this message in the terminal for a user to review, refine, or accept when a `git add...` command has been run.

## Preview Features

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.
