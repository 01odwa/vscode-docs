## GitHub Universe, Copilot, and VS Code

If you were able to watch or attend [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this year, you saw that [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was center stage. Copilot was featured in the [Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQkdDVupQE) and breakout sessions such as [GitHub Copilot: the AI pair programmer for today and tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAT4zCfzsHI).

The VS Code team has been working hard to integrate Copilot into the editor and you can learn more about the team's progress leading up to GitHub Universe in the recent [Pursuit of "wicked smartness" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/11/13/vscode-copilot-smarter) blog post. The post details the development of Copilot **agents**, that behave as subject matter experts on code bases and technologies, and describes how extension authors will be able to contribute their own custom agents to VS Code.

## Accessibility

### Accessible View

Last iteration, we introduced automatic closing of the Accessible View when a key is pressed for a seamless flow between a UI component and its Accessible View. In some cases, this behavior might not be desirable and can now be disabled via the `accessibility.accessibleView.closeOnKeyPress` setting.

If a user often toggles between the terminal and the terminal Accessible View, they might want to enable `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewFocusOnCommandExecution`, which automatically opens the view when a command has been executed in the terminal.

### Tooltips shown on keyboard focus

To improve the experience for keyboard users, tooltips are now shown on keyboard focus for items with custom hovers such as Activity bar and Status bar items.

### New setting `accessibility.voice.speechTimeout`

A new setting `accessibility.voice.speechTimeout` controls how long to wait during silence before accepting speech input to the chat box. By default, voice input is automatically submitted after `1.2` seconds of silence. You can set this to `0` to disable auto accepting speech input entirely.

## Workbench

### Floating Editor Windows

TODO@bpasero

### Settings editor search improvements and bugfixes

The Settings editor is back to sorting search results by match type first again, rather than only by the table of contents. In other words, title and keyword matches show up at the top again, meaning you don't have to scroll down just to find a setting with a matching title.

![Settings editor showing the windows.titleBarStyle setting appearing first when searching "title bar style"](images/1_85/se-search-fixed.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

The Settings editor still orders settings by the table of contents for tie-breakers though, meaning that extension authors' `order` keys are respected for search queries such as `@ext:<extension-id>`.

Many Settings editor regressions have also been fixed this iteration, including the Settings editor failing to load due to networking issues, and the Settings editor hanging on certain search queries.

### Native Paste support in the explorer

The explorer now supports natively pasting from the OS's explorer into the VS code explorer.

## Editor

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Sticky scroll

Sticky scroll has landed in the terminal! Using the knowledge provided by [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) the prompt of the command at the top of the viewport will stick to the top of the terminal, similar to how the [same feature works in the editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_sticky-scroll).

![Running ls in the terminal will show the ls prompt at the top of the terminal](images/1_85/terminal-sticky-scroll.png)

Clicking the sticky scrolled section will scroll to that part of the terminal buffer.

This is currently disabled by default but can be enabled by setting `"terminal.integrated.stickyScroll.enabled": true`. We plan on enabling this by default in the future at which point opting out will be as simple as right clicking and toggling it off.

### Command highlighting

Hovering a command in the terminal will now show a highlight bar to its left. This is particularly useful for plain terminal prompts where it's not as clear where one command starts and the other ends.

![Hovering a command will show a line to the left of it that highlights the command and its output](images/1_85/terminal-command-highlighting.png)

### Shell integration and command navigation improvements

With the introduction of sticky scroll, many improvements were made to how shell integration works. This applies particularly to Windows where the markers that we receive from shell integration aren't totally reliable. There is now some logic that will intelligently scan some of the terminal contents and adjust the markers before making the terminal command available to various features.

Shell integration is also now capable of detecting the prompt part of the prompt and the input part of the prompt, this determines what part of the command displays when using sticky scroll. This will also trim empty lines from the top of the prompt which are common to split up output and make the terminal easier to read.

The existing [command navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-navigation) feature benefits from this by navigating to the more reliable prompt that would be used for sticky scroll, rather than the old less reliable prompt line.

Before:

![Before only a single line would be highlighted](images/1_85/terminal-command-nav-before.png)

After:

![When navigating commands the entire prompt is now highlighted](images/1_85/terminal-command-nav-after.png)

### Improved underline rendering

Dashed and dotted underlines in the terminal are now rendered in a pixel perfect pattern:

![Dotted and dashed underlines are now pixel perfect](images/1_85/terminal-underline.png)

![The underline improvements also works when zoomed in](images/1_85/terminal-underline-zoom.png)

### Git pull Quick Fix

If the checkout of a branch can be fast forwarded, a new terminal Quick Fix provides the option to run `git pull`.

## Tasks

The `npm.packageManager` setting can now be set to `bun` to enable detection and running of [Bun](https://bun.sh) scripts defined in `package.json`.

## Notebooks

## Debug

### JavaScript Debugger

#### Visualize Heap Snapshots

V8 heap snapshots, saved as `.heapsnapshot` can now be visualized in VS Code. We include both a traditional tabular view as well as a graphical representation of the retainers of a give memory object.

![](./images/1_85/heap-snapshot.png)

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Heap snapshots can be captured using the "Take Performance Profile" command while debugging any JavaScript code. They can also be captured via the "Memory" tab in browser devtools.

#### Improved Event Breakpoints View

The "Event Breakpoints" view shown while debugging Edge or Chrome has been improved. It's now a checkbox list, and we also support pausing on XHR/fetch requests based on the URL.

![](./images/1_85/event-listener-bps.png)

#### WebAssembly Debugging with Rust

Both VS Code and `wasm-bindgen` have made changes that allow Rust compiled to WebAssembly to be debugged in VS Code. See our documentation on [WebAssembly debugging](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_debugging-webassembly) for more information.

## Testing

The "find" widget is now supported in terminal in the **Test Results** view.

## Languages

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_85.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat UI Improvements

The line chat prompt history is now persisted across VS Code sessions. We also aligned the keybindings to see previous prompt, like in other places it is now `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown`.

When inline chat proposes to create new files, like with `/test`, you can now chose the file name and location by selecting "Create As" from its drop down.

![Create and Create As for newly suggest files of inline chat](images/1_85/inline-chat-create.png)

Last, there is a new _experiemental_ light weight UI mode for inline chat. It provides a smoother streaming experience and renders diffs only on demand. You can enable it via the `"inlineChat.mode": "live3"` setting.

![Light weight mode with diff on demand](images/1_85/inline-chat-live3.png)

#### Terminal generate commit message quick fix

Last release, a Copilot [Generate Commit Message "sparkle"](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_84#_commit-message-generation) was added to the Source Control view input box. For terminal users, there is now a Quick Fix to generate a commit message in the terminal that a user can review, refine, or accept after running the `git add...` command.

#### Terminal agent and command suggestion improvements

All terminal related features have moved to the `@terminal` agent. This was done to make it clear that the terminal agent may not pull in workspace information, to consolidate the functionality and make it more convenient to use.

Here are the mappings from old to new:

| Old | New
|---|---
| `@workspace /terminal how do I list files?` | `@terminal how do I list files?`
| `@workspace /explain #terminalSelection` | `@terminal #terminalSelection`
| `@workspace /explain #terminalLastCommand` | `@terminal #terminalLastCommand`

In addition to this, command suggestion saw big improvements this release. It will now know about the operating system and shell. Workspace information will also be conditionally pulled in, based on whether Copilot thinks the question is related to the workspace. The workspace context is expected to be improved over time, both in terms of speed and what exactly gets referenced.

![Progress of fetching workspace details will be displayed](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-context.png)

Notice how this example knows how the file paths are formed when used in the `microsoft/vscode` repository:

![The terminal agent is capable of answering questions that need knowledge about file naming standards in the repository](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-suggest.png)

There are also convenient follow ups to explain the suggested commands presented as a blue sparkle link just above the chat input box:

![The blue sparkle link just before the input box explains the suggestion](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-explain-link.png)

Activating the explain follow up will give a detailed explanation of the suggested command:

![The detailed explanation will typically explain the command and each argument](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-explanation.png)

#### Authentication upgrade modal when using GitHub remote search capabilities on private repos

If enabled for your user account, when you use the `@workspace` agent, we will search your workspace using remote search capabilities. In order to use this with private repositories, an authentication token with more permission is required. If we don't have a token with the needed permissions already, we will ask for additional permission:

![auth dialog when you search the workspace](images/1_85/auth-dialog.png)

You'll only see this one time and future queies to the `@workspace` agent will use this cached token.

## Preview Features

### Alternate character filtering for Korean

For various features across the workbench that use filtering we will now also search the qwerty keyboard equivalent as it's common to accidentally not switch IMEs. This works similar to search engines but in real time. For example `debug` when typed in a korean IME is `ㅇ듀ㅕㅎ` which is non-sensical:

![Searching for a "ㅇ듀ㅕㅎ" command will now present results for "debug"](images/1_85/korean-filtering.png)

Currently this does not work when filtering from the middle of the word.

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Test Coverage

This iteration we revived work on test coverage, with initial UI integration and some minor tweaks to the longstanding proposal. While the API is too lengthy to include here, we believe it to be fairly straightforward, and would welcome your input on the proposal in [issue #123713](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123713).
