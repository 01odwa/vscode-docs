## GitHub Universe, Copilot, and VS Code

If you were able to watch or attend [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this year, you saw that [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was center stage. Copilot was featured in the [Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQkdDVupQE) and breakout sessions such as [GitHub Copilot: the AI pair programmer for today and tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAT4zCfzsHI).

The VS Code team has been working hard to integrate Copilot into the editor and you can learn more about the team's progress leading up to GitHub Universe in the recent [Pursuit of "wicked smartness" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/11/13/vscode-copilot-smarter) blog post. The post details the development of Copilot Chat **agents**, that behave as subject matter experts on code bases and technologies, and describes how extension authors will be able to contribute their own custom agents to VS Code.

## Accessibility

### Accessible View

Last iteration, we introduced automatic closing of the Accessible View when a key is pressed for a seamless flow between a UI component and its Accessible View. In some cases, this behavior might not be desirable and can now be disabled via the `accessibility.accessibleView.closeOnKeyPress` setting.

If you find yourself toggling between the terminal and the terminal Accessible View, you might want to enable `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewFocusOnCommandExecution`, which automatically opens the Accessible View after a command is executed in the terminal.

### Tooltips shown on keyboard focus

To improve the experience for keyboard users, tooltips are now shown on keyboard focus for items with custom hovers such as Activity bar and Status bar items.

### Speech detection timeout

A new setting `accessibility.voice.speechTimeout` controls how long to wait during silence before accepting speech input, for example to Copilot Chat. By default, voice input is automatically submitted after `1.2` seconds of silence. You can set this to `0` to disable accepting speech input entirely.

## Workbench

### Floating editor windows

We are happy to announce that with this release you can move editors out of the main window into their own lightweight windows. Changes to an editor in the one window apply immediately to all other windows where the editor is opened.

The easiest way to create a floating editor window is to drag an editor out of the window and drop it on some empty space on your desktop:

<video src="images/1_85/float_1.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Floating window by drag and drop"></video>

_Theme: [GitHub Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)_

The new `workbench.editor.dragToOpenWindow` setting can disable this behavior.

There are also new global and contextual commands to move or copy editors and editor groups into their own windows:

<video src="images/1_85/float_2.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Command to Copy Editor into New Window"></video>

* **View: Copy Editor into New Window** (`workbench.action.editor.copyWithSyntaxHighlightingAction`)
* **View: Move Editor into New Window** (`workbench.action.editor.moveEditorToNextWindow`)
* **View: Copy Editor Group into New Window** (`workbench.action.editor.copyGroupToNextWindow`)
* **View: Move Editor Group into New Window** (`workbench.action.editor.moveGroupToNextWindow`)
* **View: New Empty Editor Window** (`workbench.action.newWindow`)

The editor area in these windows can be freely arranged as you are used to with any complex layout you want. And since both terminals and search results can be opened as editor, you can now have these features in separate windows as well!

![Terminal and Search as editors in a floating window](images/1_85/float_3.png)

Give this new feature a try and report back any issues you encounter. Make sure to [review our existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aworkbench-auxwindow) and cast your vote on missing features.

### Settings editor search improvements and bug fixes

The Settings editor is back to sorting search results by match type first, rather than only by the table of contents. In other words, title and keyword matches show up at the top, so you don't have to scroll down to find a setting with a matching title.

![Settings editor showing the windows.titleBarStyle setting appearing first when searching "title bar style"](images/1_85/se-search-fixed.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

The Settings editor still orders settings by the table of contents for tie-breakers, meaning that extension authors' `order` keys are respected for search queries such as `@ext:<extension-id>`.

Many Settings editor regressions were also fixed this iteration, including the Settings editor failing to load due to network issues and hanging on certain search queries.

### Native paste support in the File Explorer

VS Code now supports natively pasting files from your operating system's Explorer into the VS Code File Explorer.

### Extension auto update control

You can now choose which extensions to auto update. This is helpful if you do not want to auto update all extensions but selectively choose which ones to auto update. You can either select an extension or all extensions from a publisher to auto update. You can also choose to auto update all extensions from a publisher and then unselect individual extensions from that publisher.

![Choose extensions to auto update](images/1_85/select-auto-update-extensions.png)

You should have auto updates disabled or enabled for selected extensions to use this feature.

![Auto update mode](images/1_85/auto-update-mode.png)

### New Profile icons

The following new Profile icons are available to add to your profiles.

![New Profile icons](images/1_85/new-profile-icons.png)

* `vr`
* `piano`
* `coffee`
* `snake`
* `robot`
* `game`
* `chip`
* `music`

## Editor

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Sticky scroll

Sticky scroll has landed in the terminal! Using the knowledge provided by [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration), the prompt of the command at the top of the viewport will stick to the top of the terminal, similar to how the [same feature works in the editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_sticky-scroll).

![Running ls in the terminal will show the ls prompt at the top of the terminal](images/1_85/terminal-sticky-scroll.png)

Clicking the sticky scrolled section will scroll to that part of the terminal buffer.

This is currently disabled by default but can be enabled by setting `"terminal.integrated.stickyScroll.enabled": true`. We plan on enabling this by default in the future at which point opting out will be as simple as right clicking and toggling it off.

### Command highlighting

Hovering a command in the terminal will now show a highlight bar to its left. This is useful for plain terminal prompts where it's not clear where one command starts and the other ends.

![Hovering a command will show a line to the left of it that highlights the command and its output](images/1_85/terminal-command-highlighting.png)

### Shell integration and command navigation improvements

With the introduction of sticky scroll, many improvements were made to how shell integration works. This applies particularly to terminals running on Windows, where the markers that we receive from shell integration aren't totally reliable. There is now logic that will intelligently scan the terminal contents and adjust the markers before making the terminal command available to various features.

Shell integration is also now capable of detecting the distinct parts of a prompt; the prompt and its input. This determines what part of the command displays when using sticky scroll. This will also trim empty lines from the top of the prompt, commonly used to split up output and make the terminal easier to read.

The existing [command navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-navigation) feature also benefits from this to be able to navigate to the more reliable prompt used for sticky scroll, rather than the less reliable prompt line.

Before:

![Before only a single line would be highlighted](images/1_85/terminal-command-nav-before.png)

After:

![When navigating commands the entire prompt is now highlighted](images/1_85/terminal-command-nav-after.png)

### Improved underline rendering

Dashed and dotted underlines in the terminal are now rendered in a pixel perfect pattern:

![Dotted and dashed underlines are now pixel perfect](images/1_85/terminal-underline.png)

![The underline improvements also works when zoomed in](images/1_85/terminal-underline-zoom.png)

### Git pull Quick Fix

If the checkout of a branch can be fast forwarded, a new terminal Quick Fix provides the option to run `git pull`.

## Tasks

The `npm.packageManager` setting can now be set to `bun` to enable detection and running of [Bun](https://bun.sh) scripts defined in `package.json`.

## Notebooks

## Debug

### JavaScript Debugger

#### Visualize heap snapshots

V8 heap snapshots, saved as `.heapsnapshot`, can now be visualized in VS Code. There is both a traditional tabular view as well as a graphical representation of the retainers of a given memory object.

![Graphical view of a heap snapshot showing references to a specific memory object](images/1_85/heap-snapshot.png)

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Heap snapshots can be captured using the **Take Performance Profile** command while debugging any JavaScript code. They can also be captured via the **Memory** tab in browser DevTools.

#### Improved Event Listener Breakpoints view

The **Event Listener Breakpoints** view, shown while debugging the Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browsers, has been improved. It's now a checkbox list, and supports pausing on XHR/fetch requests based on the URL.

![Event Listener Breakpoints view with "XHR/fetch URL" checked and "Add new URL" option highlighted](images/1_85/event-listener-bps.png)

#### WebAssembly debugging with Rust

Both VS Code and `wasm-bindgen` have made changes that allow Rust compiled to WebAssembly to be debugged in VS Code. See our documentation on [WebAssembly debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_debugging-webassembly) for more information.

## Testing

The **Find** control is now supported in the **Test Results** view terminal.

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.3

This release includes [TypeScript 5.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-3/). This major update adds support for import attributes, better type narrowing, and more. It also includes new language tooling features and bug fixes.

You can read more about TypeScript 5.3 in the [TypeScript blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-3).

### node_module symbols excluded from workspace symbol

[Go to Symbol in Workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_go-to-symbol-in-workspace) now excludes symbols from `node_modules` by default. This makes it easier to find symbols in your code without getting overwhelmed by symbols from installed packages.

You can revert to the previous behavior that included all symbols in the project by setting `"typescript.workspaceSymbols.excludeLibrarySymbols": false`.

### Jump to definition for inlay hints

Types in JavaScript and TypeScript [inlay hints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_inlay-hints) are now interactive. Quickly jump to a type's definition by hovering over the type and clicking while holding `kbstyle(Ctrl)` on Windows and Linux or `kbstyle(Cmd)` on macOS:

![Hover showing Go to Definition hint using Ctrl/Cmd + click](images/1_85/ts-inlay.png)

### Prefer using 'type' for auto imports

[Type-only imports](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-export) let you import a type while ensuring the import gets fully erased at runtime. If you prefer to always default to `type` imports, you can now set `"typescript.preferences.preferTypeOnlyAutoImports": true` and auto imports will use type-only import. This setting is off by default.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

* Automatically install the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extensions in Dev Containers.
* Finer control over which extensions are installed in Dev Containers.
* Reuse local machine certificates in local Dev Containers and WSL sessions.

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_85.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline chat UI improvements

The inline chat prompt history is now persisted across VS Code sessions. The keyboard shortcuts to see the previous and next prompts were also changed to be `kbstyle(Up)` and `kbstyle(Down)` to align with other previous and next shortcuts in VS Code.

When inline chat proposes creating new files, such as when using the `/test` slash command, you can now chose the file name and location by selecting **Create As** from the **Create** drop down.

![Create and Create As for newly suggest files of inline chat](images/1_85/inline-chat-create.png)

Last, there is a new **experimental** lightweight UI mode for inline chat. It provides a smoother streaming experience and renders diffs only on demand. You can enable it via the `"inlineChat.mode": "live3"` setting.

![Light weight mode with diff on demand](images/1_85/inline-chat-live3.png)

#### Terminal generate commit message Quick Fix

Last release, a Copilot [Generate Commit Message "sparkle"](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_84#_commit-message-generation) was added to the Source Control view input box. For terminal users, there is now a Quick Fix to generate a commit message in the terminal that a user can review, refine, or accept after running the `git add...` command.

#### Terminal agent and command suggestion improvements

All terminal related features have moved to the `@terminal` agent. This was done to make it clear that the terminal agent may not pull in workspace information, to consolidate the functionality, and make it more convenient to use.

Here are the mappings from old to new:

| Old | New
|---|---
| `@workspace /terminal how do I list files?` | `@terminal how do I list files?`
| `@workspace /explain #terminalSelection` | `@terminal #terminalSelection`
| `@workspace /explain #terminalLastCommand` | `@terminal #terminalLastCommand`

In addition, command suggestions saw big improvements this release. Terminal command suggestions now know about the operating system and the shell used. Workspace information is also conditionally pulled in, based on whether Copilot thinks the question is related to the workspace. The workspace context is expected to be improved over time, both in terms of speed and what exactly gets referenced.

![Progress of fetching workspace details will be displayed](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-context.png)

Notice how this example knows how the file paths are formed when used in the `microsoft/vscode` repository:

![The terminal agent is capable of answering questions that need knowledge about file naming standards in the repository](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-suggest.png)

There are also convenient follow-ups to explain the suggested commands, which are presented as a blue sparkle link just above the chat input box:

![The blue sparkle link just before the input box explains the suggestion](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-explain-link.png)

Activating the explain follow-up gives a detailed explanation of the suggested command:

![The detailed explanation typically explains the command and each argument](images/1_85/copilot-terminal-explanation.png)

#### Authentication upgrade dialog when using GitHub remote search capabilities on private repos

If enabled for your user account, when you use the `@workspace` agent, Copilot Chat searches your workspace using remote search capabilities. In order to use this with private repositories, an authentication token with more permission is required. If there isn't a token with the needed permissions already, you will be prompted for additional permission:

![Authentication dialog when searching the workspace](images/1_85/auth-dialog.png)

You'll only see this one time and future queries to the `@workspace` agent will use this cached token.

#### Send a request to @workspace more easily

Since the `@workspace` agent is used in many Copilot queries, we wanted to make sure it's as easy as possible to activate. You can now type a question in the chat input, then press `kb(workbench.action.chat.submitSecondaryAgent)` to send the question and automatically prepend `@workspace`.

#### Copilot videos and livestream sessions

Don't miss the recent [VS Code Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5_hvBl2SE-7YCHYlLQ0bPt) videos on YouTube. Learn about the [latest Copilot Chat features](https://youtu.be/Dlt-DCLHnxM) and using Copilot with specific programming languages such as [Java](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhCB95cE0HY) and [C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsUQlSyQn1E).

And if you haven't been tuning in to the [VS Code livestreams](https://code.visualstudio.com/livestream), you'll want to watch the Copilot demos featured in the [1.84 release party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63DjsjdR3s).

### Python

#### Show Type Hierarchy with Pylance

You can now more conveniently explore and navigate through your Python projects' types relationships when using [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance). This can be helpful when working with large codebases with complex type relationships.

When you right-click on a symbol, you can select **Show Type Hierarchy** to open the type hierarchy view. From there you can navigate through the symbols' subtypes as well as supertypes.

<video src="images/1_85/show-type-hierarchy-pylance.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Show Type Hierarchy with Pylance"></video>

_Theme: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc/Catppuccin%20Macchiato))_

#### Configurable debugging option under the Run button menu

The [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy) extension now has a configurable debug option under the **Run** button menu. When you select **Python Debugger: Debug using launch.json** and there is an existing `launch.json` in your workspace, it shows all the available debug configurations that you can pick to start the debugger. If there aren't any, you are prompted to select a debug configuration template to create a `launch.json` file for your Python application.

![Python Debugger: Debug using launch.json option under the Run button menu](images/1_85/python-debug-with-config-button.png)

#### Deactivate command supported when activated using environment variables

The [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension has a new activation mechanism that activates the selected environment in your default terminal without running any explicit activation commands. This is currently behind an experimental flag and can be enabled through the following **User** setting: `"python.experiments.optInto": ["pythonTerminalEnvVarActivation"]`.

However, one problem with this activation mechanism is that it didn't support the `deactivate` command. We received feedback that this is an important part of some users' workflow, so we have added support for `deactivate` when the selected default terminal is PowerShell or Command Prompt. We have plans to add support for additional terminals in the future.

#### Warning message and setting for REPL Smart Send

When attempting to use Smart Send via `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` on a Python file that contains invalid or deprecated code, there is now a warning message and a setting to deactivate REPL Smart Send. Users are also allowed to change and set their user and workspace specific behavior for REPL Smart Send.

![Settings editor entry for Python REPL Smart Send](images/1_85/enable-repl-smart-send.png)

## Preview Features

### Alternate character filtering for Korean

For various features across the workbench that use filtering, VS Code will now also search the QWERTY keyboard equivalent as it's common to accidentally forget to switch the language Input Method Editor (IME). This works similar to search engines but in real time. For example, `debug` when typed in a Korean IME is `ㅇ듀ㅕㅎ`, which is nonsensical:

![Searching for a "ㅇ듀ㅕㅎ" command will now present results for "debug"](images/1_85/korean-filtering.png)

Currently this does not work when filtering from the middle of the word.

### Hide Problem decorations

There is a new setting to hide Problem decorations in the editor and throughout the workbench (excluding the Problems view). The setting **Problems: Visibility** (`problems.visibility`) is enabled by default to show all problems.

Some Problems UI settings are disabled when **Problems: Visibility** is off:

* **Outline > Problems: Badges** (`outline.problems.badges`)
* **Outline > Problems: Colors** (`outline.problems.colors`)
* **Outline > Problems: Enabled** (`outline.problems.enabled`)
* **Problems > Decorations: Enabled** (`problems.decorations.enabled`)

A warning is shown in the Status Bar when this setting is off.

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Test coverage

This iteration we revived work on test coverage, with initial UI integration and some minor updates to the longstanding proposal. While the API is too lengthy to include here, we believe it to be fairly straightforward, and would welcome your input on the proposal in [issue #123713](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123713).

### Chat Agents

As mentioned in our recent blog post, [Pursuit of "wicked smartness" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/11/13/vscode-copilot-smarter#_extensibility), we have been developing a model for extensions to contribute chat agents to the Copilot Chat view. The chat agent API is proposed, but you can experiment with adding your own chat agent now. Subscribe to [issue #199908](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/199908) for updates.
