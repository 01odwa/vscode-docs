# November 2023 (version 1.85)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the November 1.85 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the November milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[November iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/197438)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22November+2023%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## GitHub Universe, Copilot, and VS Code

If you were able to watch or attend [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) this year, you saw that [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was center stage. Copilot was featured in the [Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQkdDVupQE) and breakout sessions such as [GitHub Copilot: the AI pair programmer for today and tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAT4zCfzsHI).

The VS Code team has been working hard to integrate Copilot into the editor and you can learn more about the team's progress leading up to GitHub Universe in the recent [Pursuit of "wicked smartness" in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2023/11/13/vscode-copilot-smarter) blog post. The post details the development of Copilot **agents**, that behave as subject matter experts on code bases and technologies, and describes how extension authors will be able to contribute their own custom agents to VS Code.

## Accessibility

### Accessible View

Last iteration, we introduced automatic closing of the Accessible View when a key is pressed for a seamless flow between a UI component and its Accessible View. In some cases, this behavior might not be desirable and can now be disabled via the `accessibility.accessibleView.closeOnKeyPress` setting.

If a user often toggles between the terminal and the terminal Accessible View, they might want to enable `terminal.integrated.accessibleViewFocusOnCommandExecution`, which automatically opens the view when a command has been executed in the terminal.

### Tooltips shown on keyboard focus

To improve the experience for keyboard users, tooltips are now shown on keyboard focus for items with custom hovers such as Activity bar and Status bar items.

## Workbench

### Settings editor search improvements and bugfixes

The Settings editor is back to sorting search results by match type first again, rather than only by the table of contents. In other words, title and keyword matches show up at the top again, meaning you don't have to scroll down just to find a setting with a matching title.

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

The Settings editor still orders settings by the table of contents for tie-breakers though, meaning that extension authors' `order` keys are respected for search queries such as `@ext:<extension-id>`.

Many Settings editor regressions have also been fixed this iteration, including the Settings editor failing to load due to networking issues, and the Settings editor hanging on certain search queries.

## Editor

## Source Control

## Terminal

### Git pull Quick Fix

If the checkout of a branch can be fast forwarded, a new terminal Quick Fix provides the option to run `git pull`.

## Tasks

The `npm.packageManager` setting can now be set to `bun` to enable detection and running of [Bun](https://bun.sh) scripts defined in `package.json`.

## Notebooks

## Debug

### JavaScript Debugger

#### Visualize Heap Snapshots

V8 heap snapshots, saved as `.heapsnapshot` can now be visualized in VS Code. We include both a traditional tabular view as well as a graphical representation of the retainers of a give memory object.

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Heap snapshots can be captured using the "Take Performance Profile" command while debugging any JavaScript code. They can also be captured via the "Memory" tab in browser devtools.

#### Improved Event Breakpoints View

The "Event Breakpoints" view shown while debugging Edge or Chrome has been improved. It's now a checkbox list, and we also support pausing on XHR/fetch requests based on the URL.

#### WebAssembly Debugging with Rust

Both VS Code and `wasm-bindgen` have made changes that allow Rust compiled to WebAssembly to be debugged in VS Code. See our documentation on [WebAssembly debugging](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_debugging-webassembly) for more information.

## Testing

The "find" widget is now supported in terminal in the **Test Results** view.

## Languages

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_85.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Terminal generate commit message quick fix

Last release, a Copilot [Generate Commit Message "sparkle"](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_84#_commit-message-generation) was added to the Source Control view input box. For terminal users, there is now a Quick Fix to generate a commit message in the terminal that a user can review, refine, or accept after running the `git add...` command.

## Preview Features

## Extension authoring

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [@vscode/dts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dts) and run `npx @vscode/dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Test Coverage

This iteration we revived work on test coverage, with initial UI integration and some minor tweaks to the longstanding proposal. While the API is too lengthy to include here, we believe it to be fairly straightforward, and would welcome your input on the proposal in [issue #123713](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123713).

## Engineering

## Notable fixes

* [195796](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/195796) Searching for text after localization is not supported in the Settings editor

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
