## Core

### Load Certificates in WSL and Local Dev Containers

For Remote-WSL and local Dev Containers, the local machine's certificates are now also loaded for extensions running in the remote environment. This enables extensions to use HTTPS in scenarios where, e.g., a self-signed certificate for development or a corporate proxy with a custom certificate authority is used.

### Opt-Out of Extensions

If a base image or feature configures an extension that you do not want to have installed in your Dev Container, you can now opt-out of it by listing it with a minus sign in the `extensions` section of your Dev Container configuration file. For example:

```json
{
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20-bookworm",
	"customizations": {
		"vscode": {
			"extensions": [
				"-dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Install GitHub Copilot and Pull-Request Extensions if Install Locally

If you have one of the following general-purpose extensions installed locally, it will now automatically be installed in your Dev Container:
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
- [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)

You can control the default extensions in the user settings:

### Archiving of microsoft/vscode-dev-containers Repository

[containers.dev](https://containers.dev) has been the new and expanded home for Dev Containers for some time now. We have now archived its former home, the [microsoft/vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) repository.

Most of the content has been moved to the repositories under the [devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers) org on GitHub. Two container features didn't make the move: `homebrew` and `fish`. If you are using either of these, please check the list of [available community features](https://containers.dev/features) on containers.dev for replacements.
